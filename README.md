### Service Discovery in Kubernetes
- Kubernetes auto-generates service environment variables when we create a service.
- `Automatic Service Discovery`: Service Environment Variables: Kubernetes injects environment variables into each Pod based on the Services available at the time the Pod is created. This allows Pods to easily discover and connect to Services.
- Pod name available via HOSTNAME variable.
- Service name available via SERVICE_NAME variable.
- We can call another service using ``SERVICE_NAME_SERVICE_HOST:PORT`` eg: ``CURRNECY_EXCHANGE_SERVICE_HOST:8000``


### Kubernetes Service and Deployment Management with yaml
1. **Notes**
- To get the yaml of a deployment or service and save it to a file
  - `kubectl get deployment currency-exchange -o yaml >> deployment.yaml`
  - `kubectl get svc currency-exchange -o yaml >> service.yaml`
- We can combine the deployment and service yaml into a single file by adding ``---`` between them
- If we make changes to the yaml file, we can apply the changes using `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`
- To see the diff of the changes that will be applied, we can use `kubectl diff -f deployment.yaml`

2. **Simplifying yaml**
- Simplify the deployment.yaml file by removing unnecessary fields:
  - Remove: Creation timestamp, generation, resource version, self link, UID, progress deadline, revision history limit, termination message path, termination message policy, DNS policy, schedule name, security context, termination grace period in seconds, and status.
  - Keep: Labels, name, namespace, replicas, selectors, strategy, and template.

3. **Deployment Configuration**

- Pod Template: Contains container specs such as image, image pull policy, and container name. Multiple containers can be specified within a pod.
- Restart Policy: Set to Always to ensure containers are restarted if they fail.
- Labels: Apply to both the pod and the deployment for identification. 
- Deployment Specs:
  - Replicas: Define the number of pod replicas.
  - Strategy: Use RollingUpdate to update pods incrementally.
  - Match Labels: Ensure deployment targets the correct pods.

4. **Service Configuration**
- Port: Define the port on which the service listens.
- Target Port: Define the port on which the service forwards requests to the pod.
- Service Specs:
  - Type: Set to LoadBalancer to expose the service externally.
  - Session Affinity: Set to None for REST APIs; session affinity is used for applications requiring all requests to go to the same instance.

# Service Discovery Issue: Missing K8S Environment Variables When Services Start in Incorrect Order

### Issue Explanation:

1. **Service Discovery with Kubernetes:**
    - Kubernetes provides a way for services to discover each other using DNS and environment variables. When a pod starts, Kubernetes sets up environment variables for each service that is currently available.
    - For example, if we have a service called `currency-exchange`, Kubernetes might set an environment variable like `CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_SERVICE_HOST` with the hostname or IP of the `currency-exchange` service.

2. **Problem Scenario:**
    - Suppose we have two services: `currency-conversion` and `currency-exchange`.
    - **If** the `currency-conversion` service pod starts **before** the `currency-exchange` service pod is up, the `currency-conversion` pod will not receive the environment variable `CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_SERVICE_HOST` because the `currency-exchange` service does not yet exist or is not yet available.
    - In this case, the `currency-conversion` pod will fail to discover the `currency-exchange` service because it doesnâ€™t have the necessary environment variable set.

3. **Service Availability and Environment Variables:**
    - Once the `currency-exchange` service is up, Kubernetes will create environment variables for it. However, this happens after the initial creation of the pod. If the `currency-conversion` pod was started before `currency-exchange` was available, it wonâ€™t receive the updated environment variables dynamically.
    - Kubernetes doesnâ€™t update environment variables of existing pods if a service becomes available later. Environment variables are set only once when the pod starts.

### Solution Explanation:

To avoid this problem, we can use a **custom environment variable** approach:

1. **Custom Environment Variable:**
    - Instead of relying on Kubernetes to automatically set environment variables for your services, explicitly define a custom environment variable in the podâ€™s deployment configuration.
    - For example, in the `currency-conversion` service's deployment configuration, we would set an environment variable named `CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_URI` with a value like `http://currency-exchange`.

2. **Advantages:**
    - By explicitly defining the custom environment variable, we ensure that your `currency-conversion` service has a consistent way to find the `currency-exchange` service, even if the `currency-exchange` service starts after the `currency-conversion` service pod.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
    - Modify the `deployment.yaml` for the `currency-conversion` service to include the custom environment variable.
    - Deploy the updated configuration, ensuring that the environment variable is available from the start.

### Summary:

- **Issue:** If `currency-conversion` starts before `currency-exchange`, it wonâ€™t get the `currency-exchange` environment variable and might fail.
- **Solution:** Define a custom environment variable in the deployment configuration to ensure consistent service discovery and avoid relying on dynamically-set environment variables that might not be available at startup.


# Centralized Configuration Management with Kubernetes ConfigMaps

In Kubernetes, to avoid hardcoding configuration values, you can use `ConfigMaps` for centralized configuration management.

1. **Create a ConfigMap**:
    - Use the command `kubectl create configmap confmap_name --from-literal=env_name=env_value` to create a ConfigMap with the key-value pair.
    - For example, `kubectl create configmap currency-conversion --from-literal=CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_URI=http://currency-exchange` creates a ConfigMap named `currency-conversion` with the key `CURRENCY_EXCHANGE_URI` and value `http://currency-exchange`.
    - As best practice, redirect the ConfigMap to a YAML file using `kubectl get configmap confmap_name -o yaml >> configmap.yaml` then move the ConfigMap to deployment configuration.    

2. **Verify ConfigMap**:
    - Check the ConfigMap using `kubectl get configmap` and `kubectl get configmap currency-conversion-service -o yaml` to view its YAML configuration.

3. **Update Deployment YAML**:
    - Add the ConfigMap configuration to your `deployment.yaml` file.
    - Comment out any hardcoded environment variables.
    - Reference the ConfigMap for environment variables in the deployment configuration.

4. **Apply Changes**:
    - Apply the updated `deployment.yaml` with `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`.
    - Ensure the new pod is launched and the service is operational.

5. **Benefits**:
    - ConfigMaps allow for centralized management of configuration data for microservices and different environments.

# Kubernetes Downtime and Zero Downtime Deployments
### Introduction to Kubernetes Downtime and Zero Downtime Deployments
- When deploying a new version of a service, mistakes such as incorrect image names can lead to failed deployments. Kubernetes, however, intelligently maintains the old version of the service to ensure continued operation. The challenge arises during the transition between service versions, where brief periods of downtime may occur if the new version takes time to start up while the old one is being shut down. This downtime is undesirable, and the issue is how to avoid it while ensuring smooth and reliable deployments.
`{"timestamp":"2024-08-14T16:03:43.772+00:00","status":500,"error":"Internal Server Error","path":"/currency-conversion-feign/from/USD/to/IN
  R/quantity/10"}`.
### Brief solution to downtime

The solution to avoid downtime during deployments in Kubernetes involves using ``Liveness`` and Readiness ``Probes``. These probes check the health and readiness of a microservice. The Readiness Probe ensures that traffic is only directed to a service when it's ready, preventing downtime during startup. The Liveness Probe monitors the ongoing health of the service and restarts it if necessary. By configuring these probes, Kubernetes can ensure smooth transitions between service versions, avoiding downtime by only terminating old versions once the new ones are fully operational.
spring actuator provides a health endpoint that can be used for readiness and liveness probes by just adding some properties in the application.properties file.
